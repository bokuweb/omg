# omg web demo

Static page: `index.html` + `app.js` + `engine.js` + `cache.js` +
`presets.js` + `pkg/` (wasm-bindgen output of `crates/omg-web`).
transformers.js is loaded from jsDelivr; model weights stream from the
Hugging Face Hub once and are kept in IndexedDB (`cache.js`, plugged in as
`env.customCache`: Chromium's Cache API rejects the large `.onnx_data`
shards, so the default cache only kept the small files). Loaded models also
stay resident for the page's lifetime, so switching back is instant.
Nothing is uploaded.

```bash
# build the wasm (once per omg-core change)
cargo build --release -p omg-web --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
wasm-bindgen --target web --out-dir web/pkg --out-name omg target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/omg_web.wasm
wasm-opt -Oz -o web/pkg/omg_bg.wasm web/pkg/omg_bg.wasm

# serve
python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory web
open "http://localhost:8765/"
```

In addition to the three Bekko models below, the page offers five models: `gemma-4-e2b-wgpu-ja` (the default) and
`gemma-4-e4b-wgpu-ja`, Gemma 4 E2B / E4B on omg's own wgpu engine, and
`laya-multilingual-wgpu`, Convai's Laya (mmBERT encoder + decision head,
docs/laya.md) on the same engine — 180 MB (Q8, 56k-token vocabulary,
`tools/export_laya.py`), one bidirectional sequence per question, ~50 ms
for a 3-question request; fetched from the `laya-v1` release into
`./models/` by `fetch-models.sh` (small enough for the Pages site). Two
more run on the Laya loader: `ruri-v3-310m-cross-wgpu` (326 MB) and
`ruri-v3-70m-cross-wgpu` (78 MB), Ruri v3 trained as Laya-shaped
cross-encoders (docs/cross.md; `tools/export_cross.py`, release
`cross-v1`). The
sentence-embedder backends (multilingual-e5-small, Ruri v3 130m / 310m
with a trained (state, option) head; docs/e5.md, docs/ruri.md; releases
`e5-v1`, `ruri-v1`) run on the engine too (`kind: "e5"` in engine.js) but
are not listed: the head never reads a question's instructions, so every
noul question over one state gets the same answer — they are a native
option (`omg serve --model <export>`) for question families a head was
trained on, not a general System One. The
Gemma models share the same 25k-token vocabulary, 1.2 GB / 2.5 GB, streamed from the Hugging
Face repos `bokuweb/gemma-4-E2B-it-grande-wgpu-ja` /
`bokuweb/gemma-4-E4B-it-grande-wgpu-ja` (or from `./models/<id>/` when
that directory exists). Requires WebGPU (Chrome / Edge, Safari 26+). `engine.js` still carries the loaders
for everything else this page has run — the Gemma 3 / Gemma 4 ONNX exports
through transformers.js, the full-vocabulary `gemma-4-e2b-wgpu` (2.8 GB),
the trained 270M pointer model — so an entry can be put back in `MODELS`
(specs in git history); the sections below describe those paths too.
Gemma 4 ONNX models are loaded text-only (`Gemma4ForCausalLM`): the audio
and vision encoder shards (270 MB for E2B) are never fetched.

## Bekko System One

Choose `bekko-system-one-17m`, `bekko-system-one-68m`, or
`bekko-system-one-400m`, then **Load model** and **Use English example**.
[Open the 17M demo](https://bokuweb.github.io/omg/?model=bekko-system-one-17m)
to start with the English product-review preset (choice, noul, and score).
CPU / WASM is the default; **Device** also offers WebGPU with CPU fallback.
The downloads are approximately 29 MB, 196 MB, and 1.43 GB respectively;
inference needs additional memory, especially with long inputs.

This integrates [hotchpotch's browser demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hotchpotch/bekko-system-one-in-browser).
The models are experimental English decision models, so the Japanese presets
are not representative examples. Each question accepts 2–64 options.
The original tokenizer layout, candidate descriptions, noul context wrapper,
and task-specific logit column are preserved. `omg-core` validates requests,
owns option ordering, and computes temperature-scaled probabilities,
confidence, and the score expectation in the usual omg response format.
Each question runs separately; **Modes**, **Orders**, and **Calibrate** are
disabled for Bekko. Long instructions/state and candidates are truncated to
the model manifest's query/document limits (currently 4,096/2,048 tokens).

`bekko-worker.js` loads pinned ONNX Runtime Web 1.30.0 and Hugging Face
Tokenizers 0.2.0 from jsDelivr. A single-threaded worker keeps CPU inference
off the UI thread and works on GitHub Pages without cross-origin isolation.
`bekko.js` pins each model and tokenizer to one Hub revision; assets use the
same IndexedDB cache and **Clear cache** control as the other models. Runtime
scripts still require network access or the browser's HTTP cache on reload.
For local weights, `?base=/models/&model=bekko-system-one-17m` reads
`/models/bekko-system-one-17m/{manifest.json,tokenizer.json,tokenizer_config.json,model.onnx}`
(the contents of the upstream `onnx_browser` directory).
The adapted tokenizer/inference helpers retain their upstream MIT license in
[`bekko-LICENSE.txt`](bekko-LICENSE.txt).

Run the adapter tests without installing npm dependencies:

```bash
node --experimental-default-type=module --test web/bekko.test.mjs
```

## Existing engines

What runs where:

- `omg-core` (wasm): request validation, the rendered layout (Gemma 3 and
  Gemma 4 turn markers), the branch plan (`plan` / `plan_second`: option
  orders to average, the group and finalist passes of a Choice with more
  than 52 options), option labels, temperature / softmax / confidence, the
  TypeSafe-shaped response. Same crate as the native runtime, so **Orders**
  in the page is `--orders` and a 77-way Choice runs the same two stages as
  `omg serve` (the page shows `2-stage N` and the order `spread` per
  question).
- `engine.js`: tokenizes the rendered segments (control tokens in caller text
  are neutralized the same way as native), decodes the state once into a KV
  cache, continues every question from it with `num_logits_to_keep = 1`, and
  reads the label logits and candidate mass. **Calibrate** (on by default)
  runs the same questions over the content-free state `N/A` once (cached per question,
  never through the resident cache) and hands those logits to
  `omg.answer`, which subtracts them before the softmax — contextual
  calibration, the same `--baseline` as native.

Modes:

- `shared` (default): the state is decoded once and its KV cache stays
  resident in the engine; every question continues from that cache as its
  own forward, so a branch sees the state and itself only, exactly the
  native layout. The next request over the same state skips the state pass
  (`usage.state_resident: true`). One forward per question because ORT's
  GroupQueryAttention requires `batch_size == 1` when a multi-token input
  continues from a cache — and a refused run leaves the session unusable, so
  the tiled-cache single forward is not attempted. A branch forward is
  short (only its own tokens), so what remains is ORT's per-dispatch cost.
- `batched`: one forward where every row is `state + question`, right- or
  left-padded. The state is re-read once per question.
- `sequential`: one forward per `state + question`, for comparison.

The trained pointer model (`grande-270m-ja`, a hidden-state export without
a KV cache) always runs batched, so it still re-reads the state per question.

`grande-270m-ja-wgpu` is the same checkpoint on omg's own engine
(`crates/omg-wgpu`, compiled into `pkg/omg_bg.wasm` and run on WebGPU
through wgpu): state and every question in one forward pass with a
block-causal mask, no ONNX Runtime. Its files (`config.json`,
`tokenizer.json`, `head.safetensors`, `model.safetensors` f16, 320 MB) come
from `tools/export_wgpu.py` and live in `models/grande-270m-ja-wgpu/`
(release `wgpu-v1`; neither 270M model is in the page's list or fetched by
`fetch-models.sh` any more). Measured with the
GPU shared with a training job, interleaved with the ONNX model: ticket
0.17–0.55 s vs 0.86–1.35 s, contract 0.41–0.74 s vs 2.9–4.0 s.

`gemma-4-e2b-wgpu` is Gemma 4 E2B on the same engine: the llama.cpp Q4_0
GGUF repacked by `tools/export_wgpu_gguf.py` into a `manifest.json`
directory (one file per layer, `embed.bin`, and the 1.3 GB
`per_layer_table.bin` of per-layer token embeddings, 2.8 GB in all). The
loader streams the files into the engine one at a time (`WgpuLoader`);
the per-layer table stays in JS and its rows are gathered and dequantized
per request. Zero-shot label readout, one pass, no resident state: ticket
1.16 s, contract 2.5 s on an idle M4 (the ONNX path: 2.5–2.8 s / 3.1–5.2 s).
The files are served from `./models/gemma-4-e2b-wgpu/` when present (local
development: export there or symlink) and otherwise from the Hugging Face
repo `bokuweb/gemma-4-E2B-it-grande-wgpu` — GitHub Pages caps a site at
1 GB and release assets are not CORS-enabled — uploaded with
`tools/upload_wgpu_hf.py`. Until the repo exists the entry is listed
disabled ("not published yet"), so the site deploys either way.

`gemma-4-e2b-wgpu-ja` (the one the page ships) is the same export from
the vocabulary-pruned GGUF (`tools/prune_vocab.py`: 262k → 25,392 tokens
from JGLUE train, kev's suites and the examples; `docs/comparison.md` §4):
`per_layer_table.bin` 1.3 GB → 128 MB, `embed.bin` 455 → 69 MB, 1.2 GB in
all, and the same answers to four decimals on the ticket, natively and in
the browser (from the Hub: 1.14 s warm on an idle M4). Text inside the
pruning corpus tokenizes exactly as with the full vocabulary; outside it
~5% more pieces (contract preset 639 → 674 tokens).

`gemma-4-e4b-wgpu-ja` is Gemma 4 E4B through the same pipeline
(`gemma-4-E4B-it-Q4_0.gguf` → `prune_vocab.py` with the same corpus, which
keeps the identical 25,392 token ids since both sizes share the tokenizer →
`export_wgpu_gguf.py`): 4.6 GB → 2.5 GB, answers equal to the unpruned GGUF
on llama.cpp to the last digit on the ticket, wgpu vs llama.cpp ≤ 7e-5.
E4B has two K/V heads (grouped-query attention, 4 query heads each), which
the attention kernel dispatches as one workgroup column per K/V head.
Ticket ~2.5 s warm on an M4 in the browser (E2B ~1.0 s).

The ONNX counterpart exists too: `tools/prune_onnx_vocab.py` applied to the
onnx-community export with the same token set drops the embedding,
per-layer-embedding and `lm_head` rows of the other 237k tokens
(embed_tokens 1,591 → 154 MB, decoder 1,520 → 1,310 MB) and renumbers
`tokenizer.json` to match. Logits are bit-identical to the full export for
any text that tokenizes the same (checked on CPU ORT; `shared` on the
ticket preset gives the same numbers to the last digit), 1.5 GB, published
as `bokuweb/gemma-4-E2B-it-ONNX-ja` (spec: `kind: "gemma4"`, `hub` = the
repo id, `padding: "right"`). `?base=http://host/path/` fetches a Hub
model's files from `${base}${id}/` instead (and skips the published-or-not
probe), e.g. a `python3 -m http.server` over a directory of exports while a
freshly pruned one is being checked.

Padding (`batched` only): Gemma 3 causal-LM exports honour `attention_mask`
/ `position_ids`, so rows are left-padded and only one logits position is
kept. The Gemma 4 multimodal export does not — padded rows read the pads as
context and the answers are wrong (noul questions collapsed to ~0.97 with
candidate mass 0.001). For it the batch is right-padded and logits are kept
at every position (capped at 64M elements, above that it falls back to
sequential). `shared` never pads, so it is not affected.

Measured (M4, 16 GB, Chromium WebGPU, Gemma 4 E2B q4f16; `shared` cold =
state decoded in this request, warm = state already resident):

| request | tokens (shared / batched) | shared cold | shared warm | batched | sequential |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ticket, 5 questions, 90-token state | 313 / 673 | 2.8 s | 2.5 s | 4.6 s | 4.2 s |
| contract, 8 questions, 232-token state | 639 / 2,263 | 5.2 s | 3.1 s | 12.1 s | 13.1 s |

gemma-3-270m on the contract: shared 1.7 s cold / 0.9 s warm, sequential
3.2 s. The remaining cost per branch on E2B is ~90 ms fixed + ~7 ms per
token (ORT WebGPU at small batch), which is why the ticket's five ~45-token
branches take 2.5 s even with the state resident.

`shared` and `sequential` agree to max |Δp| 1e-5 on the contract (logits
differ by up to 0.8 in fp16 where the probability is already saturated);
Gemma 4 E2B answers in the browser match the native llama.cpp run
(`refund_requested` 0.010 vs 0.037 Q4_0; the rest within a few 1e-3).
`batched` on Gemma 4 is the exception: the right-padded batch moves noul
logits by up to ~2 (`refund_requested` 0.002), same answers. With the
262k vocabulary the ticket's 673 × 262,144 logits exceeded the cap, so
`batched` silently ran as `sequential`; the 25k-token export is the first
to actually run it in one forward.
